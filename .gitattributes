# .gitattributes â€” help GitHub Linguist count SQL
# Linguist docs: https://github.com/github/linguist#overrides
#
# 1) Ensure .sql files are classified as SQL (GitHub shows "SQL", not "MySQL").
*.sql linguist-language=SQL

# 2) Make sure the sql/ folder is not treated as vendored (it usually isn't,
#    but this line prevents accidental exclusion if folder names change).
sql/** linguist-vendored=false

# 3) (Optional) If you want to exclude large assets or docs from language stats,
#    uncomment these. It can make SQL show up with a bigger percentage.
# assets/** linguist-documentation
# **/*.png linguist-documentation
# **/*.jpg linguist-documentation
# **/*.md  linguist-documentation
